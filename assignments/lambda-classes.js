// CODE here for your Lambda Classes
/*
- We have a school to build here! This project will get you used to thinking about classes in JavaScript and building them from a brand new data set.
* Lambda personnel can be broken down into three different types of people.
    - Instructors - extensions of Person
    - Students - extensions of Person
    - Project Managers - extensions of Instructors
IMPORTANT - You'll need to create 2 - 3 objects for each class and test them according to their unique Attributes. For example:
​
const fred = new Instructor({
  name: 'Fred',
  location: 'Bedrock',
  age: 37,
  favLanguage: 'JavaScript',
  specialty: 'Front-end',
  catchPhrase: `Don't forget the homies`
});
​
*/
​
// * First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
// * Person receives `name` `age` `location` all as props
// * Person receives `speak` as a method.
// * This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name` and `location` are the object's own props
​
​
​
// * Instructor has the following unique props:
//   * `specialty` what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
//   * `favLanguage` i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
//   * `catchPhrase` i.e. `Don't forget the homies`
// * Instructor has the following methods:
//   * `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
//   * `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'
​
​
// * If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! 
//   * Otherwise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
​
​
​
// * ProjectManagers are extensions of Instructors
// * Project Manger has the following unique props:
// * `gradClassName`: i.e. CS1
//   * `favInstructor`: i.e. Sean
// * ProjectManagers have the following Methods:
//   * `standUp` a method that takes in a slack channel and logs `{name} announces to {channel}, @channel standy times!
//   * `debugsCode` a method that takes in a student object and a subject and logs out `{name} debugs {student.name}'s code on {subject}`
​
​
​
// * Student has the following unique props:
//   * `previousBackground` i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
//   * `className` i.e. CS132
//   * `favSubjects`. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
// * Student has the following methods:
//   * `listsSubjects` a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
//   * `PRAssignment` a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the `student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}`
//   * `sprintChallenge` similar to PRAssignment but logs out `student.name has begun sprint challenge on {subject}`
​
/*
Stretch Problem
* Extend the functionality of the Student by adding a prop called grade and setting it equal to a number between 1-100.
* Now that our students have a grade build out a method on the Instructor (this will be used by BOTH instructors and PM's) that will randomly add or subtract points to a student's grade. Math.random will help.
* Add a graduate method to a student.
    - This method, when called, will check the grade of the student and see if they're ready to graduate from Lambda School
    - If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! Otherwise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
